Use Of AI
I had trouble figuring out how to animate my sprite so I asked ChatGPT on how I could go about this. It told me to store each frame of the animation in an array and then use the Jave Timer to go through each of the frames using increments, and then to loop back around when it reaches the end by using "frame = (frame + 1) % length of frame".
From this I understood that the frame variable holds which index of the array to access and the DIV is used to loop back to 0. Not only did this help me understand how to animate the sprite, it also introduced me to Timers which I then went on to use in majority of my other classes.

Another problem I had was getting the “+2 Speed” to be displayed next to the player and to follow its movement, as it would show up in the top left corner instead. Therefore, I asked ChatGPT  for help with this. Originally I was using player.getPosition() to find the coordinates for the string, but ChatGPT informed me that because I was using g.drawString(), I was using screen coordinates rather than world coordinates in which the player moves in. Therefore, using this help, I found out about Point2D, from extra research and IntelliJ’s auto-completion, which uses world coordinates in Java and used this instead to find the position of the text. This taught me that there is a difference between screen and world coordinates.
